                In 2010, The Pastry House opened its first kiosk location in Malad, Mumbai. From its inception, The Pastry House is known as bakery unique for our cupcakes and cakes. We take pride in using natural ingredients in our cupcakes, cakes and desserts.
                Our treats are as deliciously wholesome as they are beautifully decorated. Choose from our signature cupcakes, weekly and holiday specials or custom created desserts. <br>
                We create custom cakes for all occassions - be it a birthday, wedding, anniversary or festive season. The cakes can be created based on flavours and designs which you prefer. If you want the best cakes in Mumbai, we are the place to go!
